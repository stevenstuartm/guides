### Incident Response Quick Reference

#### Immediate Actions (First 30 minutes)
1. **Isolate affected systems** - Prevent lateral movement
2. **Preserve evidence** - Don't power off systems unnecessarily
3. **Notify incident response team** - Activate response procedures
4. **Document initial observations** - Timeline and impact assessment
5. **Assess scope and severity** - Determine classification level
6. **Notify management** - Initial briefing on situation

#### Investigation Phase (Hours 1-24)
1. **Collect and preserve evidence** - Memory dumps, logs, network captures
2. **Analyze attack vectors** - How did the incident occur?
3. **Determine scope of compromise** - What systems/data affected?
4. **Identify threat actor TTPs** - Attribution and capability assessment
5. **Assess data impact** - What information was accessed/stolen?
6. **Update stakeholders** - Regular communication to leadership

#### Recovery Phase (Days 1-7)
1. **Eradicate threat** - Remove malware, close attack vectors
2. **Restore systems** - Clean rebuilds where necessary
3. **Monitor for persistence** - Watch for threat actor return
4. **Implement additional controls** - Prevent recurrence
5. **Validate security posture** - Penetration testing, security assessment
6. **Document lessons learned** - Process improvements
