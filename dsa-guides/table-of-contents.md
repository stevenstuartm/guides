## How to Use This Guide

**For Learning:** Start with Foundation Concepts, then move through Linear → Non-Linear → Graph structures. Learn algorithms after understanding the data structures they operate on.

**For Interview Prep:** Focus on Decision Guide and Interview Guide first, then drill specific algorithms based on common interview patterns.

**For Quick Reference:** Use the Complexity Cheat Sheet and Decision Guide for rapid lookup during problem-solving.

**Language Coverage:** Each file contains both Python and C# implementations with practical "when to use" guidance.
