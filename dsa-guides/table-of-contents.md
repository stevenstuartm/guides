## How to Use This Guide

**For Beginners:** Start with Big O Basics and Tree/Graph Fundamentals. These provide gentle introductions with real-world analogies.

**For Interview Prep:** Focus on Decision Guide first, then drill Algorithm Design Paradigms and basic data structures.

**For Advanced Learning:** After mastering basics, explore Advanced Trees, Advanced Graph Algorithms, and Advanced Complexity Analysis.

**For Quick Reference:** Use the Complexity Cheat Sheet and Decision Guide for rapid lookup during problem-solving.

**Learning Progression:** Foundation Concepts → Linear Structures → Basic Non-Linear → Advanced Structures → Algorithms → Reference Materials

**Language Coverage:** All examples use C# with modern .NET best practices, practical "when to use" guidance, and real-world applications.
