← [Back to Main Study Guides](../README.md)

## Overview

This collection covers essential Software Development Lifecycle methodologies, practices, and tools that guide successful software project delivery from conception to maintenance.

## Study Guides

### 1. [SDLC Methodologies](./sdlc.md)
Comprehensive guide covering SDLC phases, methodologies, project management, and development best practices.

**Topics Covered:**
- SDLC phases and activities
- Agile, Waterfall, and hybrid methodologies
- Project management best practices
- Quality assurance and testing strategies
- DevOps integration and continuous delivery

### 2. [UML Diagrams](./uml-diagrams.md)
Complete guide to Unified Modeling Language diagrams for system design and documentation.

**Topics Covered:**
- Most useful UML diagram types
- When to use each diagram in SDLC phases
- Practical examples with PlantUML syntax
- Best practices for modeling and documentation
- Integration with development workflows

## Learning Path Recommendations

### For Project Managers
1. **[SDLC Methodologies](./sdlc.md)** - Focus on project management and methodology sections
2. **[UML Diagrams](./uml-diagrams.md)** - Use case diagrams and activity diagrams for requirements

### For Software Architects
1. **[UML Diagrams](./uml-diagrams.md)** - Class, component, and deployment diagrams
2. **[SDLC Methodologies](./sdlc.md)** - Architecture design phases and practices

### For Developers
1. **[SDLC Methodologies](./sdlc.md)** - Development phases and best practices
2. **[UML Diagrams](./uml-diagrams.md)** - Class and sequence diagrams for implementation

### For Quality Assurance
1. **[SDLC Methodologies](./sdlc.md)** - Testing strategies and quality assurance
2. **[UML Diagrams](./uml-diagrams.md)** - Sequence diagrams for test scenario design

## How to Use These Guides

### For Process Improvement
- Review current practices against SDLC best practices
- Identify gaps in methodology implementation
- Use UML diagrams to improve documentation standards

### For Team Training
- Use guides as reference material for team onboarding
- Create workshops around specific SDLC phases
- Practice UML modeling with real project examples

### For Project Planning
- Apply SDLC phase templates to project planning
- Use UML diagrams for requirements and design documentation
- Integrate modeling practices into development workflows

## Key Concepts

### SDLC Fundamentals
- **Requirements Analysis**: Gathering and documenting system requirements
- **System Design**: Architectural and detailed design phases
- **Implementation**: Coding and unit testing
- **Testing**: Integration, system, and acceptance testing
- **Deployment**: Release management and production deployment
- **Maintenance**: Bug fixes, enhancements, and support

### UML Modeling Benefits
- **Communication**: Clear visual representation of system concepts
- **Documentation**: Standardized notation for technical documentation
- **Design Validation**: Early detection of design issues
- **Code Generation**: Automated code generation from models
- **Team Alignment**: Shared understanding of system architecture
