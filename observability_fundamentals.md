## Overview

Observability is the ability to understand a system's internal state based on its external outputs. In distributed systems, observability enables developers and operations teams to understand what's happening across complex architectures, identify performance bottlenecks, troubleshoot issues, and ensure system reliability.

**Core Definition**: Observability uses three pillars of telemetry data—metrics, logs and traces—to make vast computing networks easier to visualize and understand.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Faster Problem Resolution**: Identify and fix issues before they impact users
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Detect problems before they become critical
- **System Understanding**: Gain insights into complex distributed system behavior
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Incident Response**: Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) during outages

## Observability vs Monitoring

Understanding the distinction between monitoring and observability is crucial for implementing effective system visibility strategies.

| Aspect | Monitoring | Observability |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **What is it?** | Measuring and reporting on specific metrics within a system, to ensure system health. | Collecting metrics, events, logs, and traces to enable deep investigation into health concerns across distributed systems with microservice architectures. |
| **Main focus** | Collect data to identify anomalous system effects. | Investigate the root cause of anomalous system effects. |
| **Systems involved** | Typically concerned with standalone systems. | Typically concerned with multiple, disparate systems. |
| **Traceability** | Limited to the edges of the system. | Available where signals are emitted across disparate system architectures. |
| **System error findings** | The *when* and *what*. | The *why* and *how*. |
| **Approach** | Reactive: Responds to known problems | Proactive: Discovers unknown unknowns |
| **Data Sources** | Predefined metrics and alerts | Multiple correlated data sources |
| **Question Answered** | "Is the system working?" | "Why is the system not working?" |

**Key Insight**: Observability is a broader version of monitoring that allows operations teams to be proactive and resolve sophisticated issues faster.

## Events: The Foundation

The "Three Pillars of Observability" all rely on the concept of "Events". Events are essentially the basic building blocks of monitoring and telemetry—distinct occurrences that can be defined, something discrete and unique that happened.

**Event Characteristics:**
- **Temporal**: Occur at a specific time
- **Quantifiable**: Have measurable attributes
- **Contextual**: Include associated metadata and context
- **Traceable**: Can be correlated across systems

**Example**: A user pressing the "Pay Now" button on an eCommerce site creates an event with expectations (payment page loads within 2 seconds), context (user ID, session), and measurable outcomes (response time, success/failure).

Events are the raw material that feeds into all three pillars of observability, making them integral to understanding
