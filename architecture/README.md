# Distributed Systems Architecture Patterns - Study Guide

## Overview

This guide covers essential patterns for building distributed systems. Each pattern addresses specific challenges and trade-offs in distributed computing, providing a toolkit for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.

## Pattern Categories

### 1. [Communication Patterns](./communication_patterns.md)
Define how services and components interact with each other in distributed systems.
- Load Balancing
- Publisher-Subscriber (Pub/Sub)
- Request-Response
- Event Streaming

### 2. [Integration Patterns](./integration_patterns.md)
Define how different systems and services work together, enabling data flow and coordination.
- Pipes and Filters
- Scatter-Gather
- Content-Based Router
- Message Translator

### 3. [Orchestration and Choreography](./orchestration_choreography.md)
Define how multiple services coordinate to complete complex business processes.
- Orchestration Pattern
- Choreography Pattern
- Saga Pattern

### 4. [Data Management Patterns](./data_management_patterns.md)
Address how distributed systems handle data storage, access, and consistency.
- Database per Service
- Shared Database
- Event Sourcing
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Materialized View

### 5. [Reliability Patterns](./reliability_patterns.md)
Help systems handle failures gracefully and maintain availability.
- Circuit Breaker
- Retry Pattern
- Bulkhead Pattern
- Timeout Pattern

### 6. [Messaging Patterns](./messaging_patterns.md)
Ensure reliable, consistent, and efficient message handling in distributed systems.
- Transactional Outbox
- Transactional Inbox
- Claim Check
- Dead Letter Queue
- Priority Queue

### 7. [Deployment and Infrastructure Patterns](./deployment_infrastructure_patterns.md)
Address how applications are deployed, managed, and operated in distributed environments.
- Sidecar Pattern
- Ambassador Pattern
- Backend for Frontend (BFF)
- Service Mesh

### 8. [Migration Patterns](./migration_patterns.md)
Help organizations modernize legacy systems gradually and safely.
- Strangler Fig Pattern
- Anti-Corruption Layer
- Branch by Abstraction

### 9. [Performance and Scalability Patterns](./performance_scalability_patterns.md)
Focus on optimizing system performance and handling increased load.
- Throttling and Rate Limiting
- Cache-Aside
- Cache-Through
- Sharding

### 10. [Coordination Patterns](./coordination_patterns.md)
Enable multiple distributed nodes to work together effectively.
- Leader Election
- Distributed Lock
- Consensus

## Summary

When designing distributed systems:

1. **Start simple** - Use basic patterns first, add complexity as needed
2. **Consider trade-offs** - Each pattern has benefits and costs
3. **Combine patterns** - Most real systems use multiple patterns together
4. **Match patterns to problems** - Choose patterns that solve your specific challenges

Understanding these patterns provides a toolkit for building robust, scalable, and maintainable distributed systems. The key is knowing when and how to apply each pattern effectively.
