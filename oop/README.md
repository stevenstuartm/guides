# Object-Oriented Programming Study Guide

---

## Table of Contents

### Core Concepts
1. [OOP Fundamentals](oop-fundamentals.md) - Core OOP pillars and key concepts
2. [SOLID Principles](solid-principles.md) - The five SOLID principles for maintainable code

### Design Patterns

> Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. The Gang of Four (GoF) identified 23 fundamental patterns that remain relevant today.

#### GoF Pattern Categories

**Creational Patterns**
- Focus on object creation mechanisms
- Provide flexibility in how objects are instantiated
- Examples: Factory, Builder, Singleton

**Structural Patterns**
- Deal with object composition and relationships
- Help form larger structures while maintaining flexibility
- Examples: Adapter, Decorator, Facade

**Behavioral Patterns**
- Focus on communication between objects
- Define how objects interact and distribute responsibilities
- Examples: Observer, Strategy, Command

### Pattern Implementation Guides
3. [Creational Patterns](creational-patterns.md) - Builder, Factory, Singleton, and Prototype patterns
4. [Structural Patterns](structural-patterns.md) - Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy patterns
5. [Behavioral Patterns](behavioral-patterns.md) - Observer, Strategy, Command, State, and other behavioral patterns

### Modern Approaches
6. [The Result Pattern](result-pattern.md) - Functional error handling alternative to exceptions
7. [Modern Best Practices](modern-best-practices.md) - Contemporary development practices and principles

### Reference
8. [Quick Reference](oop-quick-reference.md) - Pattern summary, anti-patterns, and framework integration

## How to Use This Guide

This OOP study guide has been organized into focused topics for optimal learning and reference. Each section builds upon previous concepts while standing alone as a reference resource.

### Study Path Recommendations

**For OOP Beginners**:
Start with [OOP Fundamentals](oop-fundamentals.md) → [SOLID Principles](solid-principles.md) → [Modern Best Practices](modern-best-practices.md)

**For Design Patterns**:
Review [Creational Patterns](creational-patterns.md) → [Structural Patterns](structural-patterns.md) → [Behavioral Patterns](behavioral-patterns.md)

**For Modern Development**:
Focus on [The Result Pattern](result-pattern.md) → [Modern Best Practices](modern-best-practices.md) → [Quick Reference](oop-quick-reference.md)

### Pattern Selection Guidelines

- **Start Simple**: Don't use patterns until you have a specific problem they solve
- **Consider Alternatives**: Modern language features often provide simpler solutions
- **Focus on SOLID**: The principles are more important than memorizing all 23 patterns
- **Test-Driven**: Choose patterns that improve testability and maintainability

> **Philosophy**: Patterns are tools, not goals. Use them to solve specific problems, not because they exist. Modern development emphasizes simplicity, testability, and maintainability over pattern implementation.
